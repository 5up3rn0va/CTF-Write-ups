- On analysing the given zip file we find 2 audio files, with almost similiar audio
- Import both to audacity together
- Select and ```invert``` only the first audio 
- Then select both the audios and export it as an mp3 or wav
- Open the new mp3 in audacity, its almost silence, but viewing it in spectrogram shows the flag
